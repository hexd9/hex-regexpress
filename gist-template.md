Welcome to this tutorial on regex for password validation! Regular expressions (regex) are tools for pattern matching and validation. In this guide, I'll break down a regex pattern specifically designed for password validation, ensuring that passwords meet certain criteria for security.

## Summary

^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[!@#$%^&*]).{8,}$

My regex featured in this tutorial is designed to validate passwords based on the following criteria:

At least 8 characters long
Contains at least one uppercase letter
Contains at least one lowercase letter
Contains at least one digit
Contains at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*)
